  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This document describes DCAT-AP-JRC, the [[DCAT-AP]] extension developed by the <a
    href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/">European Commission's Joint Research Centre</a> (<abbr
    title="Joint Research Centre">JRC</abbr>), and used in the <a href="http://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">JRC Data

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>The overall mission of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/">Joint Research Centre of the European Commission</a>
    (JRC) is to support EU policies with independent evidence throughout the whole policy life-cycle. The activities of
    the JRC span many different research areas, that address and ensure a healthy and safe environment, secure energy
    supplies, sustainable mobility and consumer health and safety. Thus, the JRC is a multidisciplinary research
    organisation and the diversity of its research activities poses challenges in the management of data, since
    different scientific disciplines have their own traditions, standards and best-practices on how to manage and
    disseminate research information.</p>
  <p>In order to provide a basis for better management of data, in 2014 the JRC developed a corporate data policy&nbsp;[[JRC-DP]],
    driven by the need of transparency in the policy development life-cycle, and to facilitate open access to research
    data, in line with the general Open Data trend.</p>
  <p>As part of the activities concerning the implementation of the JRC Data Policy, JRC has set up a <a
    href="http://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/">corporate data catalogue</a>, which is meant to be a single point of access to
    data produced and/or maintained by JRC. In this context, metadata play a fundamental role, and are meant to address
    a number of requirements, which include (a) ensuring data documentation and inventory, (b) enabling data discovery
    and (c) publishing metadata on other catalogues operated by EU institutions and bodies - in particular, the <a
      href="http://data.europa.eu/euodp/">EU Open Data Portal</a>.</p>

  <p>For more details about the JRC Data Policy and its implementation, we refer the reader to [[iiWAS17-JRC]].</p>

  <p>The multidisciplinary nature of JRC datasets makes it difficult to define a consistent set of metadata elements
    able to fit all requirements. Therefore, the design of the JRC metadata schema is following a modular approach
    consisting of a <em>core</em> profile, defining the elements that should be common to all metadata records, and a
    set of domain-specific <em>extensions</em>.</p>

  <p>The reference metadata standard used is the <em>DCAT application profile for European data portals</em> (DCAT-AP)&nbsp;[[DCAT-AP]],
    and the related domain-specific extensions - namely, [[GeoDCAT-AP]] (for geospatial metadata) and [[StatDCAT-AP]]
    (for statistical metadata).</p>

  <p>[[DCAT-AP]] is a metadata profile developed in the framework of the EU Programme <a
    href="http://ec.europa.eu/isa/"><em>Interoperability Solutions for European Public Administrations</em></a> (ISA),
    and based on and compliant with the W3C Data Catalog vocabulary (DCAT) [[VOCAB-DCAT]] - currently, one of the most
    widely used Semantic Web vocabularies for describing datasets and data catalogues.</p>
  <p>The purpose of [[DCAT-AP]] is to define a common interchange metadata format for data portals of the EU and of EU
    Member States. In order to achieve this, [[DCAT-AP]] defines a set of classes and properties, grouped into
    mandatory, recommended and optional. Such classes and properties correspond to information on datasets and data
    catalogues that are shared by many European data portals, aiding interoperability.</p>

  <p>The motivation for using [[DCAT-AP]] as the reference metadata schema is manifold:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>It is the <em>de facto</em> standard metadata interchange format in European data catalogues.</li>
    <li>It is a general purpose metadata profile, easily extensible.</li>
    <li>It is based on a data model (<abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> [[RDF-CONCEPTS]])
      supporting effective linking of distributed resources.
    </li>
    <li>It is not meant to replace domain- / community-specific standards, but to make them interoperable.</li>
    <li>It is complemented by extensions (as [[GeoDCAT-AP]] and [[StatDCAT-AP]]) that can be easily re-used and
      integrated to support domain-specific requirements, whenever needed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The core profile of the JRC metadata schema (referred to as DCAT-AP-JRC) is however not using DCAT-AP <em>as
    is</em>, but it extends it with a number of metadata elements that have been identified as most relevant across
    scientific domains, and which are required in order to support data citation.</p>

  <p>The following sections provide a summary of the adopted solutions, and discuss a number of issues still to be
    addressed.</p>

</section>

<section id="methodology">

  <h2>Methodology</h2>

  <section id="reference-vocabularies">

    <h2>Reference vocabularies</h2>

    <p>The reference metadata specifications on which DCAT-AP-JRC is based are the following ones:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>DCAT-AP 1.2.1 (May 2019) [[DCAT-AP-20190528]]</li>
      <li>GeoDCAT-AP 1.0.1 (August 2016) [[GeoDCAT-AP-20160802]]</li>
      <li>StatDCAT-AP 1.0.1 (May 2019) [[StatDCAT-AP-20190528]]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>DCAT-AP-JRC builds as much as possible upon these specifications to define all those metadata elements that are
      common across scientific disciplines. However, additional vocabularies have been used whenever the reference
      specifications were not providing appropriate mechanisms to address the identified requirements.</p>

    <p>These additional vocabularies have been chosen based on the following criteria:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>They have clear persistence and versioning policies.</li>
      <li>Preferably, they should be used across domains and data communities.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The classes and properties from these additional vocabularies have been selected, whenever possible, taking into
      account other metadata standards. In particular, [[?DataCite]] has been functional to the selection of additional
      terms from [[?DCTERMS]], as [[?DataCite]] is heavily inspired on it. For this purpose, a preliminary study has
      been carried out to map DataCite to DCAT-AP [[?CiteDCAT-AP]], and the relevant mapped classes and properties have
      been incorporated into DCAT-AP-JRC.</p>

  </section>

  <section id="extensions">

    <h2>DCAT-AP-JRC extensions</h2>

    <p>As already mentioned in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#background"></a>, DCAT-AP-JRC includes all the classes
      and properties common to all metadata, irrespective of their domain.</p>

    <p>Domain-specific metadata are nonetheless supported in DCAT-AP-JRC by integrating the corresponding [[DCAT-AP]]
      extensions. Currently, the supported extensions are the following ones:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>GeoDCAT-AP-JRC</dt>
      <dd>It corresponds to the union of DCAT-AP-JRC and [[GeoDCAT-AP]]. This extension is tipically used for
        [[?ISO-19115]] metadata converted to DCAT-AP-JRC.
      </dd>
      <dt>StatDCAT-AP-JRC</dt>
      <dd>It corresponds to the union of DCAT-AP-JRC and [[StatDCAT-AP]]. This extension is tipically used for [[?SDMX]]
        metadata converted to DCAT-AP-JRC.
      </dd>
      <dt>CiteDCAT-AP-JRC</dt>
      <dd>It corresponds to the union of DCAT-AP-JRC and [[?CiteDCAT-AP]]. This extension is tipically used for
        [[?DataCite]] metadata converted to DCAT-AP-JRC.
      </dd>
    </dl>

  </section>

  <section id="metadata-scope">

    <h2>Metadata scope</h2>

    <p>As done in [[DCAT-AP]] and the other reference specifications, DCAT-AP-JRC defines the "obligation" for each
      class and property (namely, whether they are mandatory, recommended, or optional), as well as their
      cardinality.</p>

    <p>Obligations and cardinality determine the minimal requirements for DCAT-AP-JRC-compliant records. However, they
      just provide an incomplete guidance to determine which classes and properties could be relevant for specific use
      cases. E.g., describing also catalogue records is not relevant for most use cases, but it is something that cannot
      be avoided when running a data catalogue.</p>

    <p>For this reason, DCAT-AP-JRC classes and properties are annotated also with the "scope(s)" where their use is
      relevant. The used "metadata scopes" are the following ones:</p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Data documentation</dt>
      <dd>This is the primary scope of metadata, and it is supposed to be relevant for all use cases. It concerns the
        description of data for purposes concerning data discovery, provenance, context, as well as data quality and fit
        for purpose.
      </dd>
      <dt>Data citation</dt>
      <dd>This covers classes and properties which are relevant to enable data citation.</dd>
      <dt>Metadata management</dt>
      <dd>This covers classes and properties which are relevant to effectively manage and maintain metadata records in a
        data catalogue, along their whole lifecycle.
      </dd>
      <dt>Metadata sharing and re-use</dt>
      <dd>This covers classes and properties which are relevant when metadata records are harvested across catalogues
        or, more in general, shared and re-used across communities and platforms.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <p>It is worth noting that the defined scopes provide just a general classification, and therefore they are neither
      necessarily exhaustive, nor cover all use cases.</p>

<section id="requirements" class="informative">

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <p>This section illustrates the requirements behind the development of DCAT-AP-JRC, and provides as well an outline of
    the proposed solutions.</p>
  <p>Part of these requirements has been described in [[SDSVoc16-27]], and afterwards contributed for further assessment
    to the the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2017/dxwg/charter">W3C Dataset Exchange Working Group</a> (<abbr
      title="W3C Dataset Exchange Working Group">DXWG</abbr>), in charge of the revision of [[VOCAB-DCAT]]. For the list
    of these requirements, and the corresponding DXWG use cases, see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dxwg-ucr"></a>.</p>

  <section id="requirements-scientific-data">

    <h2>Requirements for scientific data</h2>

    <section id="req-across-disciplines">

      <h2>Metadata elements relevant across disciplines</h2>

      <p>The most common, cross-domain requirements we identified for JRC data are following ones:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ability to indicate dataset authors.</li>
        <li>Ability to describe data lineage.</li>
        <li>Ability to give potential data consumers information on how to use the data ("usage notes").</li>
        <li>Ability to link to (scientific) publications about a dataset.</li>
        <li>Ability to link to input data (i.e., data used to create a dataset).</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Points (2) (data lineage) and (5) (input data) are already supported by DCAT-AP via, respectively, <a
        data-cite="DCTERMS/#terms-provenance"><code
        title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/provenance">dct:provenance</code></a> and <a
        data-cite="DCTERMS#terms-source"><code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/source">dct:source</code></a>. The other
        ones are instead not supported by [[DCAT-AP]].</p>
      <p>More precisely:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>[[DCAT-AP]] includes only two agent roles, namely, publisher and contact point, but not one for dataset
            authors. However, [[GeoDCAT-AP]] does include this role, which is specified by using property <code
              title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator">dct:creator</code>. DCAT-AP-JRC uses the same approach.</p>
          <p>For more details, see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-contributor"></a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>[[DCAT-AP]] does not include specific properties for usage notes and publications about datasets, and they
            can only be specified by using the property <code
              title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/relation">dct:relation</code>, which is too generic to address the
            identified requirements. Consequently, new properties have been included in DCAT-AP-JRC for this purpose,
            namely, <code title="http://purl.org/vocab/vann/usageNote">vann:usageNote</code> (for usage notes) and <code
              title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/isReferencedBy">dct:isReferencedBy</code> (for publications).</p>
          <p>For more details, see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-usage-notes"></a> and <a
            class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-publication"></a>, respectively.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <!--
For the other ones, our approach is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dataset authors: <a data-cite="DCTERMS#terms-creator"><code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/creator">dct:creator</code></a>.</li>
<li>Usage notes: <a data-cite="VANN#usageNote"><code title="">vann:usageNote</code></a>.</li>
<li>Related (scientific) publications: <a data-cite="DCTERMS#terms-isReferencedBy"><code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/isReferencedBy">dct:isReferencedBy</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Information on dataset authors, input data and publications provide a first, simplified, picture of the "context" of a dataset, that can be used for multiple purposes. For instance, to filter datasets based on their authors or input data, to identify the most used datasets, the use cases where a dataset has been used. However, to support this effectively, a key requirement is the ability to rely on persistent identifiers.</p>
<p>In this perspective, we have integrated <a href="https://orcid.org/">ORCIDs</a>, whenever available, in dataset authors metadata, whereas all the dataset published on the JRC Data Catalogue are assigned a persistent URI from the <a href="http://data.europa.eu/">URI registry of EU institutions and bodies</a> operated by the Publications Office of the EU. This will ensure the long-term availability of metadata records also in case the existing infrastructure is migrated.</p>
<p>Such an approach ensures the ability of linking resources maintained at the corporate level, but of course this does not apply to external ones (as it happens frequently for input data) not associated with a persistent identifier.</p>
-->
    </section>

    <section id="req-data-citation">

      <h2>Data citation</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.datacite.org/">DataCite</a> is an international initiative meant to enable citation for
        scientific datasets. To achieve this, DataCite operates a metadata infrastructure, following the same approach
        used by <a href="http://www.crossref.org/">CrossRef</a> for scientific publications. As such, the DataCite
        infrastructure is responsible for issuing persistent identifiers (in particular, <abbr
          title="Digital Object Identifiers">DOIs</abbr>) for datasets, and for registering dataset metadata. Such
        metadata are to be provided according to the DataCite metadata schema [[?DataCite]] – which is basically an
        extension to the one used for DOI records.</p>

      <p>Since DataCite is currently the <em>de facto</em> standard for data citation, we started by carrying out a
        preliminary study concerning the mapping of DataCite with DCAT-AP [[CiteDCAT-AP]].</p>

      <p>Based on this work, we recognised that what needs to be added in [[DCAT-AP]] for data citation purposes is
        basically only one "field" (already mentioned above), namely, "data authors" - which matches one of the
        requirements illustrated in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#req-across-disciplines"></a>.</p>
      <!--
<p>Other issues concern mainly (a) identifiers (DOIs, ORCIDs, ISNIs, ISSNs, etc.) and (b) agent roles, which are elaborated in the following sections.</p>
-->
      <p>In addition to this, data citation requirements have been taken into account to determine which resource
        properties are mandatory, as they are essential to create a bibliographic citation. More precisely, these
        properties are the following ones:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Contributor / author (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-contributor"></a>).</li>
        <li>Title (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-title"></a>).</li>
        <li>Publisher (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-publisher"></a>).</li>
        <li>Publication date (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-publication-date"></a>).</li>
        <li>Identifiers for both the dataset (<a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-identifier"></a> and <a
          class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-other-identifier"></a>) and the contributors (<a class="no-sectionRef"
                                                                                                href="#agent-individual-other-identifier"></a>).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Finally, the information above has been complemented with a specific field for the full biliographic citation,
        which is meant to indicate which is the preferred way to cite a resource.</p>

      <aside class="note">
        <p>In the current version of DCAT-AP-JRC, the field specifying a bibliographic citation is supported only for
          datasets and publications.</p>
      </aside>

      <p>For more details, see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-bibliographic-citation"></a> (for datasets) and
        <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#publication-bibliographic-citation"></a> (for publications).</p>

    </section>

    <section id="req-contributors-order">

      <h2>Contributors' / authors' order</h2>

      <p>This requirement is strictly related to the previous two ones, of which it could be considered a
        sub-requirement.</p>

      <p>It is often the case that the order according to which contributors / authors are listed denotes the role
        played by each of them in the creation / curation of a resource. Preserving this information is frequently
        important to correctly acknowledge the level of importance and type of contribution of each contributor /
        author.</p>

      <p>In RDF, there are two specific constructs that can be used to represent an ordered set of resources, namely,
        RDF Sequences (see <a data-cite="RDF-SCHEMA#ch_seq">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">5.1.3 </span>rdf:Seq</a> in
        [[RDF-SCHEMA]]) and RDF Collections (see <a data-cite="RDF-SCHEMA#ch_collectionvocab">&sect;&nbsp;<span
          class="secno">5.2 </span>RDF Collections</a> in [[RDF-SCHEMA]]). An alternative approach, adopted in the
        [[SCoRO]] ontology, is to specify explicitly the actual type of contribution and the level of importance of a
        contributor.</p>

      <p>RDF Sequences and RDF Collections introduce, however, a high level of complexity, which affects also metadata
        management. On the other hand, [[SCoRO]] has the advantage of providing more useful information, compared with
        the simple order of contributors (which, in some cases, may not reflect their "importance" in the creation of a
        resource - e.g., the order can be just alphabetical). However, information about the actual role played by
        contributors, as well as the importance of their contribution, is typically missing, and contributors themselves
        may not be able to indicate it.</p>

      <p>For the reasons above, DCAT-AP-JRC adopts a simple mechanism, which is meant to record the contributors' /
        authors' order by listing them as a formatted string, and in addition specifies each single contributor / author
        as a separate resource.</p>

    <h2>Additional requirements</h2>

    <p>Analysing the characteristics of JRC data, we identified additional requirements which are not specifically
      related to research data.</p>

    <section id="req-dataset-collections">

      <h2>Dataset collections</h2>

      <p>The data published on the JRC Data Catalogue are maintained by different teams, and are the output of different
        projects. As a result, different people are in charge of documenting only a given subset of the published
        data.</p>
      <p>In order to cope with this situation, DCAT-AP-JRC includes the notion of "dataset collection" ("collection",
        for short), which includes the datasets whose maintenance and documentation are in charge of a specific team.
        Moreover, a team can be in charge of multiple collections, in case the related datasets are the output of
        different projects, or belong to different thematic areas, etc.</p>
      <p>The possibility of grouping the datasets of a catalogue into subsets is already supported in [[DCAT-AP]], via
        the notion of "sub-catalogue". Therefore, DCAT-AP-JRC follows the same approach for modelling collections.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="req-catalogue-endpoints">

      <h2>Catalogue endpoints</h2>

      <p>The dataset collections published on the JRC Data Catalogue are regularly harvested from different platforms
        (i.e., other catalogues), making available metadata in different formats ([[?ISO-19115]], [[?DataCite]],
        [[VOCAB-DCAT]], as well as custom metadata), and via different protocols ([[?CSW]], [[?OAI-PMH]], HTTP/FTP
        folders, custom APIs and database interfaces). Each of these platforms / catalogues can have one or more of
        these "harvesting endpoints", and, similarly, each dataset collection may be associated with one or more of
        them.</p>

      <p>In such a scenario, which is a typical situation in federated catalogues, it is important to have information
        about these harvesting endpoints, their supported metadata schemas and protocols in order to automise the
        harvesting and metadata transformation procedures. For this reason, DCAT-AP-JRC includes the notion of
        "catalogue endpoint" ("endpoint", for short), which is modelled as both a catalogue (to denote the set of
        metadata available from it) and a service / API. Moreover, each endpoint is linked to the relevant catalogue and
        collection.</p>

      <p>To model endpoints as services, DCAT-AP-JRC follows the approach defined in [[GeoDCAT-AP]].</p>

    <section id="req-dataset-catalogue">

      <h2>Dataset-catalogue relationship</h2>

      <p>When metadata records are harvested across catalogues, one of the important pieces of information is the
        original catalogue from which a record has been harvested. [[DCAT-AP]] and [[VOCAB-DCAT]] include a
        relationship, namely, <code>dcat:dataset</code>, to link a catalogue to the documented datasets, but this
        information will be lost when a dataset record is harvested in another catalogue. In order to address this
        issue, DCAT-AP-JRC makes use of property <code>dct:isPartOf</code> as the inverse property of
        <code>dcat:dataset</code>. Notably, <code>dct:isPartOf</code> is the inverse property of
        <code>dct:hasPart</code>, which is in turn the super-property of <code>dcat:dataset</code>.</p>

    <section id="req-dataset-quality-conformance">

      <h2>Dataset quality conformance</h2>

      <p>The conformance of a dataset with given quality criteria is an important piece of information to understand its
        fit for purpose, as well as the rules followed for data management.</p>
      <p>A typical example, applying both to scientific and government data, are the data policies determining why and
        how for a dataset is published, its use and access conditions, etc. Other examples concern compliance with best
        practices (as those defined in [[?DWBP]], [[?SDW-BP]], and [[?FAIR]]), interoperability frameworks (as the one
        defined in INSPIRE [[?INSPIRE-SDSS-REG]]), and specific quality policies. For a more details and examples on the
        notion of quality conformance, we refer the reader to [[?VOCAB-DQV]] - in particular, <a
          data-cite="?VOCAB-DQV#ExpressConformanceWithStandard">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">6.11 </span>Express the

          conformance of a dataset with a quality policy</a>.</p>
      <p>For this purpose, [[DCAT-AP]] supports the use of property <code>dct:conformsTo</code> to express conformance
        in the general sense, and [[GeoDCAT-AP]] re-uses it specifically to (a) specify conformance with test results
        against data quality criteria, and (b) the coordinate reference system used. DCAT-AP-JRC follows the same
        approach and, in addition, it uses property <code>dct:conformsTo</code> with class <code>dct:Policy</code> for
        the specific cases when the relevant resource is a data policy.</p>

    <section id="req-dataset-other-resources">

      <h2>"Other" dataset-related resources</h2>

      <p>Besides landing pages, distributions, publications, data lineage and usage notes, JRC datasets are often
        associated with resources with other types of relationships. They can be any type of resource - a document, a
        piece of software, a Web site, a service / API, as well as another dataset.</p>

      <p>None of these additional relationships is used in JRC datasets so frequently to require specific properties.
        For this reason, following [[DCAT-AP]], these resources are specified in DCAT-AP-JRC by using the generic
        property <code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/relation">dct:relation</code> (see <a class="no-sectionRef"
                                                                                             href="#dataset-other-resource"></a>).
      </p>

      <p>To describe this type of generic resources, which are left untyped, DCAT-AP-JRC makes use of the same
        properties used for distributions. The reason of this choice is that these properties are fit for describing
        heterogeneous resources. The difference is that the only mandatory properties are the resource title (<code
          title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/title">dct:title</code>) and the resource URL (<code
          title="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#accessURL">dcat:accessURL</code> / <code
          title="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#downloadURL">dcat:downloadURL</code>), whereas description, format, licence,
        and access restrictions are recommended or optional.</p>

      <p>The use of <code title="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#accessURL">dcat:accessURL</code> / <code
        title="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#downloadURL">dcat:downloadURL</code> for generic resources is theoretically
        incorrect, as the range of these properties is <code title="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Distribution">dcat:Distribution</code>.
        However, since these resources are left untyped, formally this use does not break compliance with [[VOCAB-DCAT]]
        or [[DCAT-AP]].</p>

    </section>

    <section id="req-identifiers">

      <h2>Identifiers</h2>

      <p>Identifiers are applicable to different resource types, and for different purposes.</p>
      <p>For simplicity, it is possible to group identifiers into two main types:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Internal / primary identifiers, which are meant to identify a resource internally to a given catalogue, and
          are also important in federated harvesting scenarios as they are a means to specify from which catalogue they
          have been harvested (this especially when such identifiers are encoded as dereferenceable URIs).
        </li>
        <li>Additional / secondary identifiers, assigned by existing registers. E.g., the scientific community makes
          wide use of different (possibly persistent) identifiers, especially for publications, but now increasingly for
          authors and data. Including in metadata the (possibly multiple) persistent identifier(s) of a resouce is
          important not only for citation purposes, but also to unambiguously link related resources.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>In DCAT-AP-JRC, internal / primary identifiers are assigned to all resources that are maintained in the
        catalogue, and that are supposed to be harvested by other catalogues. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Catalogues (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#catalogue-identifier"></a>)</li>
        <li>Catalogue records (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#catalogue-record-identifier"></a>)</li>
        <li>Collections (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#collection-identifier"></a>)</li>
        <li>Endpoints (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#endpoint-identifier"></a>)</li>
        <li>Datasets (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-identifier"></a>)</li>
        <li>Agents - i.e., contributors, authors, publishers (see <a class="no-sectionRef"
                                                                     href="#agent-individual-identifier"></a> for
          individuals, and <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#agent-organisation-identifier"></a> for organisations)
        </li>
        <li>Publications (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#publication-identifier"></a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>As far as additional / secondary identifiers are concerned, they are used in DCAT-AP-JRC for all resources that
        could be cited, or that could be part of a citation (e.g., authors / contributors). This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Catalogues (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#catalogue-other-identifier"></a>)</li>
        <li>Collections (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#collection-other-identifier"></a>)</li>
        <li>Datasets (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-other-identifier"></a>)</li>
        <li>Agents - i.e., contributors, authors, publishers (see <a class="no-sectionRef"
                                                                     href="#agent-individual-other-identifier"></a> for
          individuals, and <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#agent-organisation-other-identifier"></a> for organisations)
        <li>Publications (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#publication-other-identifier"></a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>It is worth noting that, for citation purposes, it is important to make explicit the identifier "type" (e.g.,
        DOI, ORCID, ISNI).</p>
      <!--
<p>As far as data citation is concerned, [[DataCite]] models identifiers to meet the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to identify the identifier scheme / type (e.g., DOI, ORCID, ISNI, etc.).</li>
<li>Ability to denote the primary identifier, as well as the secondary ones (in case a resource is associated with multiple persistent identifiers).</li>
</ul>
-->
      <p>For modelling identifiers, DCAT-AP-JRC follows [[DCAT-AP]], which already provides a mechanism to model
        internal and additional identifiers. More precisely:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Property <a data-cite="DCTERMS#terms-identifier"><code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/identifier">dct:identifier</code></a>
          is used for internal / primary identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>Property <a data-cite="VOCAB-ADMS#adms-identifier"><code title="http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#identifier">adms:identifier</code></a>
          is used for additional / secondary identifiers. The range of this property is class <a
            data-cite="VOCAB-ADMS#identifier"><code title="http://www.w3.org/ns/adms#Identifier">adms:Identifier</code></a>,
          which allows the specification of additional information about the identifier - identifier scheme included.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Notably, such solutions are basically reflecting the [[DataCite]] approach, which distinguishes between primary
        / alternative identifiers, and specifies their type. However, identifiers modelled in this way are of no use for
        effectively linking the relevant resources. For this reason, DCAT-AP-JRC follows the approach defined in
        [[CiteDCAT-AP]] (<a data-cite="CiteDCAT-AP#alignment-issues-identifiers">&sect;&nbsp;<span
          class="secno">6.2 </span>Identifiers</a>), and specifies identifiers both as literals and, whenever possible,
        also as URIs.</p>
      <p>More precisely:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identifiers are encoded as HTTP URIs, whenever possible, or <abbr title="Uniform Resource Names">URNs</abbr>,
          using <code>owl:sameAs</code> for URIs concerning additional / secondary identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>In addition:
          <ul>
            <li>Internal / primary identifiers are specified, as literals, with <code>dct:identifier</code>.</li>
            <li>Additional / secondary identifiers are specified, as literals, with <code>adms:identifier</code>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>For more details, see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#identifier"></a> (for identifiers modelled as literals)
        and <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mapping-identifiers-to-uris"></a> (for identifiers modelled as URIs).</p>

    <section id="req-agent-roles">

      <h2>Agent roles</h2>

      <p>The need of agent roles in addition to those supported in [[DCAT-AP]] has been already illustrated in <a
        class="no-sectionRef" href="#req-across-disciplines"></a> and <a class="no-sectionRef"
                                                                         href="#req-data-citation"></a>, where the
        importance of being able to specify the dataset author(s) / contributor(s) has been motivated.</p>
      <p>However, another issue is that the agent roles supported in [[DCAT-AP]] for specific resource types could also
        be relevant for other ones. This applies in particular to "contact points", a key role for any type of resource,
        whereas in [[DCAT-AP]] and [[VOCAB-DCAT]] they are associated only with datasets.</p>
      <p>In order to address this issue, DCAT-AP-JRC extends [[DCAT-AP]] by supporting the specification of contact
        points not only for datasets, but also for catalogues, endpoints, collections, and collection records. Following
        [[GeoDCAT-AP]], this is done by using property <code title="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#contactPoint">dcat:contactPoint</code>.
      </p>
      <p>It is worth noting that this use of <code
        title="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#contactPoint">dcat:contactPoint</code> does not respect the domain restriction
        of this property - namely, <code title="http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Dataset">dcat:Dataset</code>. This property is
        however used also on other resource types as the alternative would have been defining a new one, with exactly
        the same semantics.</p>

      <aside class="ednote">
        <p>[[?VOCAB-DCAT-2]] has relaxed the domain restriction of <a

    <section id="req-acronyms">

      <h2>Short names / acronyms</h2>

      <p>Some resource types are frequently referred to by using an acronym rather than their full "name", which act
        also as a human-targeted / mnemonic identifier. For the same reason, and also because their "length" is more fit
        for user and administration interfaces, such acronyms / short names are also used as the "primary" name of a
        resource in data management tools and catalogues.</p>
      <p>This information is supported in several metadata schemas, as [[?DataCite]] and [[?RE3DATA-SCHEMA]] (used for
        cataloguing data repositories), but [[DCAT-AP]] does not include a property for this.</p>
      <p>For these reasions, DCAT-AP-JRC uses property <code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/alternative">dct:alternative</code>
        for specifying short names / acronyms for resources as catalogues, collections, and endpoints.</p>

    <section id="req-spatial-coverage-codelists">

      <h2>Spatial coverage code lists</h2>

      <p>[[DCAT-AP]] recommends the use of code lists [[MDR-CONT]] (continents) and [[MDR-COUNTRIES]] (countries) when
        spatial coverage is to be specified with a geographical name, with the fall-back option of using
        [[?GEONAMES]].</p>
      <p>By reviewing JRC datasets, we realised that there is another reference code list used, especially for
        statistical data, namely, the <abbr title="United Nations Statistics Division">UNSD</abbr> <cite>Standard
          country or area codes for statistical use</cite> (M49) [[UNSD-M49]]. Notably, [[UNSD-M49]] includes
        geographical areas not covered by [[MDR-CONT]] and [[MDR-COUNTRIES]] - as global and sub-continental areas.</p>
      <p>For this reason, DCAT-AP-JRC includes support for [[UNSD-M49]] to complement [[MDR-CONT]] and [[MDR-COUNTRIES]]
        with additional levels of granularity (global, sub-regions, intermediate regions).</p>
      <p>As a formal definition of [[UNSD-M49]] is not available, a <abbr title="Simple Knowledge Organization System">SKOS</abbr>
        [[SKOS-REFERENCE]] representation of it has been developed, and integrated it with the [[MDR-CONT]] and
        [[MDR-COUNTRIES]] code lists. More precisely, this integrated code list makes use of [[MDR-CONT]] and
        [[MDR-COUNTRIES]] for continents and countries, respectively, and of [[UNSD-M49]] for the other geographical
        areas.</p>
      <p>These code lists cover all the relevant geographical areas, also in terms of granularity, used to indicate
        spatial coverage in JRC data. Therefore, DCAT-AP-JRC does not make use of [[?MDR-PLACES]] and [[?GEONAMES]].</p>

      <p>The types of possible access restrictions of a dataset are one of the key filtering criteria for data
        consumers. For instance, while searching in a data catalogue, users may not be interested in those data they
        cannot access (closed data), or in those data requiring users provide personal information (as data that can be
        accessible by anyone, but only after registration).</p>
      <p>In [[DCAT-AP]], this issue is partially addressed by supporting the specification of access restrictions at the
        dataset level via the [[MDR-AR]] code list (which although does not cover the case when data are accessible only
        after registration). However, in some cases, a dataset is associated with multiple distributions posing
        different constraints in terms of access rights. E.g., one distribution may be an anonymised version of the
        dataset, and it can be made publicly available, whereas the other one can be the non-anonymised version, which
        can therefore be accessible only by authorised users.</p>
      <p>For this reason, DCAT-AP-JRC supports the specification of access restrictions at the distribution level.</p>
      <p>The identified types of access restrictions are the following ones:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>No limitations</dt>
        <dd>The distribution can be anonymously accessed.</dd>
        <dt>Registration required</dt>
        <dd>The distribution can be accessed by anyone, but only after registration.</dd>
        <dt>Authorisation required</dt>
        <dd>The distribution can be accessed only by authorized users.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>These access restrictions are defined in an <em>ad hoc</em> code list. For more details, see <a
        class="no-sectionRef" href="#registers-access-restrictions"></a>.</p>

    <section id="req-distribution-types-and-functions">

      <h2>Distribution types and functions</h2>

      <p>It is often the case that distributions do not point to a file or a download page, but rather to a service /
        API from which users can access the data. Examples include SPARQL endpoints and services like [[WMS]], [[WFS]],
        etc., typically used for geospatial data. The result is that users are returned resources (as machine- or
        human-readable description of the service / API interface) providing no direct means to access the data.
        Morever, using these services / APIs may require specific expertise and/or software tools.</p>
      <p>It is therefore important to flag a distribution to clarify the "type" of resource which will be returned -
        namely, if it gives access to a service / API, or rather to a file / download page.</p>
      <p>This issue was already addressed in the framework of the DCAT-AP Implementation Guidelines [[DCAT-AP-IG]] - see
        <a
          href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/solution/dcat-application-profile-data-portals-europe/discussion/dt2-service-based-data-access"><cite>DT2:
          Service-based data access</cite></a>. DCAT-AP-JRC follows the approach defined there, by using the relevant
        values from the [[MDR-DT]] code list, and by specifying the service / API type via a <abbr
          title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr> identifying it (see <a class="no-sectionRef"
                                                                                href="#registers-service-protocols"></a>).
      </p>
      <p>An additional issue concerns whether the distribution points to a resource which gives access to the data or
        instead provides a visualisation of it. It is worth noting that this case is ortogonal to the one of the
        distribution "type" outlined above, as whether a resource has an access or visualisation "function" it is
        independent of whether this is obtained via a direct link to a file / download page or via a service / API.
        Although there is not a specific code list for this purpose, the [[MDR-DT]] code list includes a value to state
        that a distribution provides data visualisation. Therefore, DCAT-AP-JRC uses it for that purpose, whereas when
        the distribution function is not specified, the assumption is that the distribution gives access to the
        data.</p>
      <p>For more details, see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#distribution-type"></a> and <a class="no-sectionRef"
                                                                                              href="#distribution-function"></a>.

    <section id="req-data-discoverability">

      <h2>Improving data discoverability on the Web</h2>

      <p>Last years have seen the publication of an increasing amount and variety of data and a consequent proliferation
        of data catalogues. If these has had clear benefits for data consumers, who are now no longer limited to domain
        experts, finding the data you are looking for is not easy, unless you know in advance where they are available
        from.</p>

      <p>In order to address this issue, more and more data catalogues are now taking care not only of documenting data,
        but also of optimising their publication in order to make them discoverable by mainstream search engines. One of
        the techniques used for this purpose is to embed metadata in Web pages, with mechanisms as [[?HTML-RDFa]],
        [[?MICRODATA]], [[?JSON-LD]] (see <a data-cite="?JSON-LD#embedding-json-ld-in-html-documents">&sect;&nbsp;<span
          class="secno">6.20 </span>Embedding JSON-LD in HTML Documents</a>), and by using vocabularies as [[?DCTERMS]],
        [[?VOCAB-DCAT]], and [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] - which has been specifically developed for this purpose.</p>

      <p>To facilitate the indexing and discovery of datasets documented by using DCAT-AP-JRC, mapping rules have been
        defined to generate a [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] representation, that can be embedded in catalogue pages.</p>

      <p>Notably, the [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] subset for describing datasets is historically derived from [[?VOCAB-DCAT]], which
        in turn widely re-uses classes and properties from [[?DCTERMS]]. Consequently, the mapping between these
        vocabularies is pretty straightforward, although the conversion may lead to information loss - as illustrated by
        the [[?DCAT-AP]] to [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] mapping exercise documented in [[?DCAT-AP-SDO]].</p>

  <h2>Vocabulary specification</h2>

  <p>The following sections define the class and properties used in DCAT-AP-JRC. More precisely, after providing an
    overview of the classes used in DCAT-AP-JRC (<a class="no-sectionRef" href="#classes"></a>), class definitions and
    the corresponding properties are grouped as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a class="no-sectionRef" href="#mandatory-classes"></a></li>
    <li><a class="no-sectionRef" href="#recommended-classes"></a></li>
    <li><a class="no-sectionRef" href="#optional-classes"></a></li>
    <li><a class="no-sectionRef" href="#secondary-classes"></a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The tables in the following sections include these columns:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Column <strong><abbr title="Obligation">Obl.</abbr></strong> ("Obligation"), denotes whether the class /
      property is mandatory ("<strong><abbr title="Mandatory">M</abbr></strong>"), recommended ("<em><abbr
        title="Recommended">R</abbr></em>"), optional ("<abbr title="Optional">O</abbr>"), or conditional (<strong><abbr
        title="Conditional">C</abbr></strong>) - where conditional means "mandatory if given conditions are met".
    </li>
    <li>Column <strong><abbr title="Max Cardinality">MC</abbr></strong> specifies the maximum cardinality of the
      corresponding property (the minimum cardinality is always 1 for all mandatory properties, and 0 for the other
      ones). Properties having as range a plain literal, can be specified multiple times, even though their max
      cardinality is 1, provided that each instance uses a different language tag. These case is marked by using an
      asterisk after the max cardinality value (e.g., "1*").
    </li>
    <!--
<li>Column <strong>Code list</strong> specifies the code list (if any) used as values for properties and individuals for classes (in such a case, the individual MAY be specified only with the relevant code list URI, and therefore MAY be left untyped, and it is not described by any property).</li>
-->
    <li>Column <strong>Scope</strong> indicates the metadata scope(s) (see <a class="no-sectionRef"
                                                                              href="#metadata-scope"></a>) for which a
      specific class or property is relevant. The supported scopes are: data documentation (<abbr

      management (<abbr title="Metadata Management">MM</abbr>), and metadata sharing and re-use (<abbr
        title="Metadata Sharing and Re-use">MS</abbr>). When a class or property is relevant to all scopes, keyword
      "All" is used.
    </li>
    <li>Column <strong><abbr title="Specification">Spec.</abbr></strong> ("Specification") indicates the metadata
      specification (namely, [[DCAT-AP]], [[GeoDCAT-AP]], [[StatDCAT-AP]], or DCAT-AP-JRC) where the use of a specific

<p>Agents can be either individuals or organisations - usually, not both.</p>

<p>Individual and corporate contributors are modelled differently in DCAT-AP-JRC. More precisely, corporate contributors are referred to by using the relevant URI from the [[MDR-CB]] code list (or a complementary one, in case the organisations is not included there). By contrast, individual contributors are associated with a set of attributes describing them.</p>

<aside class="note">
<p>In theory, individual contributors could be specified as corporate ones, by using reference registers from which it is possible to derive information as the contributor's name. Examples of such registers could be those operating <abbr title="Open Researcher and Contributor Identifiers">ORCIDs</abbr> or <abbr title="International Standard Name Identifiers">ISNIs</abbr>.</p>

    <p>A collection denotes a subset of datasets in a catalogue, sharing some characteristics and/or provenance. E.g.,
      they can be datasets produced in the framework of a given activity / project, and/or harvested from another
      catalogue, and/or having the same thematic scope etc.</p>
    <p>A collection can also be used for supporting metadata management in a granular way. E.g., a catalogue used by
      different organisations, or by different teams of the same organisation, can use collections to limit the
      maintenance of a given set of records to a specific group. Similarly, a catalogue harvesting from other ones can
      use the same mechanism to give the owners of the harvested catalogues the possibility to configure the harvesting
      endpoint, frequency, etc.</p>
    <p>As such, a collection is basically equivalent to the [[DCAT-AP]] notion of "sub-catalogue" - i.e., a catalogue
      whose datasets are included in another catalogue.</p>

    <p>The following table lists the properties used for describing a collection.</p>

    <h2>UNSD M49</h2>

    <p>As explained in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#req-spatial-coverage-codelists"></a>, DCAT-AP-JRC makes use of a
      code list based on the UNSD Standard country or area codes for statistical use (M49) [[UNSD-M49]]] for specifying
      spatial coverage (<a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-spatial-coverage"></a>).</p>

    <p>The UNSD M49 code list provides a SKOS representation of [[UNSD-M49]], integrated with the [[MDR-CONT]] and
      [[MDR-COUNTRIES]] code lists. More precisely, it defines terms in [[UNSD-M49]] not included in [[MDR-CONT]] and
      [[MDR-COUNTRIES]], and specifies containment relationships between the geographical areas defined in these code
      lists by using the <code title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/hasPart">dct:hasPart</code> / <code
        title="http://purl.org/dc/terms/isPartOf">dct:isPartOf</code> properties.</p>

    <p>The following table lists the subset of the [[UNSD-M49]] entries used in DCAT-AP-JRC - i.e., all the [[UNSD-M49]]
      entries, with the exclusion of those corresponding to continents and countries.</p>

  <h2>Identifiers as URIs</h2>

  <p>Following the approach defined in [[?CiteDCAT-AP]] (<a
    data-cite="?CiteDCAT-AP#mapping-identifiers">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">10 </span>Identifiers</a>), in
    DCAT-AP-JRC, all identifiers are mapped to URIs, by concatenating the identifier with a URI prefix defined for each
    identifier type / scheme. Whenever possible, dereferenceable HTTP URIs/<abbr
      title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr> are used; otherwise, URNs.</p>
  <p>The mapping between the identifier type / scheme implemented in DCAT-AP-JRC is based on the relevant registries. No
    URI prefix is of course used if the identifier is already a URI (as URLs and URNs).</p>
  <p>The following table shows, for each identifier type / scheme, which is the URI prefix used in DCAT-AP-JRC, along
    with examples of the results of such mappings.</p>
  <!--
<aside class="note">
<p>DCAT-AP-JRC includes also a URI mapping for the identifiers operated by Identifiers.org. Such URI mapping is not included in [[?CiteDCAT-AP]], as this identifier type is currently not supported in [[?DataCite]].</p>

  <h2>Schema.org mapping</h2>

  <p>As explained in <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#req-data-discoverability"></a>, DCAT-AP-JRC is complemented with
    mapping rules for generating a [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] representation of metadata records, to be used for optimising the
    indexing of dataset pages.</p>
  <p>These mappings are based on those defined in [[?DCAT-AP-SDO]], partially revised to meet <a
    href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset">the Google guidelines for the description of
    datasets</a>. These guidelines are also used to choose the subset of DCAT-AP-JRC metadata to be mapped. The
    motivation for not using a full mapping of DCAT-AP-JRC records is that only a subset of [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] is used for
    indexing purposes by search engines. Consequently, the defined mappings cover only those classes and properties
    specified in the guidelines for creating records for the <a href="https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch">Google
      Dataset Search</a> service. For the same reason, the mapping is limited to dataset metadata records - which are
    currently the only type of resources indexed in Google Dataset Search.</p>

  <p>The following sections illustrate the defined mapping rules for the selected DCAT-AP-JRC classes and properties.
    Moreover, <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#schema-org-mapping-example"></a> shows an example of a [[?SCHEMA-ORG]]
    representation of a DCAT-AP-JRC record, obtained by applying the defined mapping rules.</p>

      <p>Additional mapping rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The dataset URI is used as value of properties <code>schema:url</code> and <code>schema:sameAs</code>.</li>
        <li>Property <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-theme"><code>dcat:theme</code></a> is mapped to <a
          href="http://schema.org/keywords"><code>schema:keywords</code></a>, although the latter is meant to be used
          for free text keywords (as property <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-keyword"><code>dcat:keyword</code></a>
          in [[VOCAB-DCAT]]). The reason is that [[?SCHEMA-ORG]] does not currently support a way to specify terms from
          controlled vocabularies, code lists, thesauri, and taxonomies. For more details on this issue, see <a
            data-cite="?DCAT-AP-SDO#categories-and-category-schemes">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">4.1 </span>Categories
            and category schemes</a> in [[?DCAT-AP-SDO]].
        </li>
        <li>In DCAT-AP-JRC, <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-theme"><code>dcat:theme</code></a> takes as value
          only the URI of the relevant concept. However, since <a href="http://schema.org/keywords"><code>schema:keywords</code></a>
          is instead meant to specify textual labels, the mapping rules take this information from the controlled
          vocabulary used for <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-theme"><code>dcat:theme</code></a> (namely,
          [[MDR-THEMES]]).
        </li>
        <li>Differently from <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-theme"><code>dcat:theme</code></a> and <a
          class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-keyword"><code>dcat:keyword</code></a>, which take as value a single
          keyword / concept, property <a href="http://schema.org/keywords"><code>schema:keywords</code></a> specifies a
          list of keywords, using a given character as a delimiter (a comma or a semi-colon). Consequently, the mapping
          rules join the values of possibly multiple instances of <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-theme"><code>dcat:theme</code></a>
          and <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#dataset-keyword"><code>dcat:keyword</code></a> to generate the string to
          be used as value of <a href="http://schema.org/keywords"><code>schema:keywords</code></a>.

      </ul>

    <section id="schema-org-mapping-properties-identifier">

      <p>Identifiers are mapped differently depending of their type. More precisely:</p>
      <ol>

      <h2>Spatial coverage</h2>

      <p>The mapping described in the following table are mutually exclusive, and their use depends on whether the
        spatial coverage is specified as a geographical name or as a geometry.</p>
      <p>In the former case, the actual geographical name is taken from the reference code list used, as DCAT-AP-JRC
        uses only the corresponding URI (see <a class="no-sectionRef" href="#spatial-coverage-geoname"></a>).</p>
      <p>When instead a geometry is used, the mapping rule requires an additional transformation of the geometry
        encoding from the one used in DCAT-AP-JRC to the one used in [[?SCHEMA-ORG]]. For this specific issue, we refer
        the reader to <a data-cite="?DCAT-AP-SDO#geometries">&sect;&nbsp;<span class="secno">4.7 </span>Geometries</a>
